.populate() replaces an ObjectId with the actual document it points to
=> .populate() replaces "all" the ids with the document


.populate() expects schema paths
means it wants the path defined in our schema not runtime data

✅ Populate with selected fields (String-based)
.populate("items.product", "name price image")
Only fetch name, price, image from Product


✅ Populate with options (advanced)
.populate({
  path: "items.product",
  select: "name price",
})
Same result, more flexible.

String-based populate works for ONE level only
Nested references ALWAYS require object-based populate
